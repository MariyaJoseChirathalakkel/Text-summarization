# Text Summarization 

Welcome to the Text Summarization repository! This project showcases various text summarization techniques using GPT-4, leveraging state-of-the-art NLP tools and frameworks. The repository contains two main Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files, each focusing on different summarization tasks.

## Files Overview

### 1. **summarization_1.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook is dedicated to summarizing news articles.
   - **Approach**: It uses prompt templates to guide GPT-4 in creating concise summaries of news content. The news examples used in this notebook were generated by ChatGPT, ensuring relevance and accuracy.

### 2. **summarization_2.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook is designed to summarize two stories.
   - **Approach**: It employs advanced chain methods, such as StuffDocumentChain, Map Reduce with Custom Prompts, and RefineChain, to effectively handle and summarize large volumes of text. The stories used in this notebook were also generated by ChatGPT, providing robust examples for the summarization process.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks in this repository, ensure that you have the following Python packages installed:

- **langchain**
- **openai**
- **streamlit**
- **tiktoken**
- **unstructured**
- **pdf2image**
- **pdfminer**
- **PyPDF2**

You can install all the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install langchain openai streamlit tiktoken unstructured pdf2image pdfminer PyPDF2
```

## Usage

### Running the Notebooks

1. **News Summarization**:
   - Open and run the `Text_summarization1.ipynb` notebook to summarize news articles using prompt templates.
   - The notebook includes cells that guide you through inputting text and generating summaries interactively.

2. **Story Summarization**:
   - Open and run the `Text_summarization2.ipynb` notebook to summarize two stories using advanced chain methods.
   - The notebook walks you through the process of uploading text or documents and generating detailed summaries.

### Example

To see the summarization in action, open the appropriate notebook in Jupyter, JupyterLab, or any compatible environment, and execute the cells sequentially. The notebooks will guide you through the process, leveraging GPT-4 and the specified techniques to produce summaries.
